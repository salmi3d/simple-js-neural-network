# Simple JS Neural Network

> Simple neural network based on [BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js)

It can recognize some simple two opposite things like good/bad, +/-, yes/no, true/false etc... via drawing

## How to use
First of all you need to train model for recognition. `For example`:
Try to draw plus sign **+**, then type **train** button, then type **clear** button and so on few times. Next try to draw minus sign **-**, then type **train** button, then type **clear** button and so on few times.
Afterall your model is trained and can try to draw random **+** or **-** sign and press **guess** button to recognize.
